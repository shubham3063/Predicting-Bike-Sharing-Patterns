# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns
In this project, I built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, I have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as PyTorch. I also saw how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.
